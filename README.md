a. Project Name: Chat Program

b. Project Description:

	This chat program will be a program that connects two users to a server and allows them to send text and maybe pictures back and forth. We plan to have the server running on a seperate host so that potentially any user can connect to the server and send messages with any other user also connected to the server. 

c. Deliverables
	Server Backend
	
	Client GUI

	Client Backend

d. Plan

	week 1: explore socket programming in python
	week 2: build a backend for clients
	week 3: continue working on backend, make sure program works
	week 4: set up server so clients can connect 
	week 5: continue work on server, begin building GUI
	week 6: finishing touches, finalize GUI
