"# NetProgFinal" 


a. Project Name: Chat Program

b. Project Description:

	This chat program will be a program that connects two users to a server and allows them to send text and maybe pictures back and forth. We plan to have the server running on a seperate host so that potentially any user can connect to the server and send messages with any other user also connected to the server. 

c. Deliverables
	Server Backend
	
	Client GUI

	Client Backend

d. Plan

	week 1: explore socket programming in python
	week 2: build a backend for clients
	week 3: continue working on backend, make sure program works
	week 4: set up server so clients can connect 
	week 5: continue work on server, begin building GUI
	week 6: finishing touches, finalize GUI

#Comments
1. You should follow the README.md template on blackboard to have a better layout of your README page
2. ProgressUpdades.md is missing for the first week. Download the template from Blackboard as well and start giving weekly updates
3. Be more specific on each of the deliverables by adding descriptions to them
E.g., 
* Server Backend
a. Handle client-server connection
b. Handle forwarding client messages
4. I would expect this program to support more than 2 clients at the same time and be able to send media like pictures, video...So include these in your deliverables as well
5. You have only 4 weeks for implementation, so make sure to adjust the plan accordingly
